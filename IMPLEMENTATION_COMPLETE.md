# Liveness probe (for Kubernetes)
curl -I https://www.gojumpingjack.com/api/health
```

### **Structured Logging**
```typescript
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';

// Log user actions
logger.userAction('search_flights', userId, { origin: 'LAX', destination: 'JFK' });

// Log API performance
logger.apiResponse('GET', '/api/search-airports', 200, 150);

// Log errors with context
logger.error('Database connection failed', error, { component: 'search' });
```

### **Environment Validation**
```typescript
import { validateEnvironment, getAuthConfig } from '@/lib/env';

// Validate environment on startup
validateEnvironment();

// Get typed configuration
const authConfig = getAuthConfig();
```

### **Development Commands**
